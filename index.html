                        This site is my personal blueprint for how I want to move through college with intention instead
                        of just reacting week by week. It pulls together what I learned about myself this term, the
                        goals I care about, and the concrete strategies I plan to actually use so I can stay on track
                        as a Computer Science major at Portland State.

                        <h3>College Experience So Far</h3>
                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>
                                This is my first year at PSU and I am living in the University Pointe apartments,
                                not official PSU housing, but on campus and more private. Having my own place this 
                                close to school gives me a lot of freedom, but it also means that I am fully responsible
                                for managing my time and money. Paying rent is an intense bill each month that I'm not used
                                to. It also means making sure I am always on top of my work, with full responsibility for 
                                my routines. There is no parent in the next room reminding me about homework.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Academically, the biggest change has been the pace and the amount of reading and writing.
                                In high school I could usually get away with starting things late and still doing well.
                                Deadlines were less strict, late policies weren't always enforced and it allowed me to
                                build the bad habit of falling behind, because I had the easy ability to catch back up.
                                Here, assignments stack up fast across all of my classes. There is always something due
                                at the end of the week, and if I ignore Canvas for even a few days, I will certainly fall 
                                behind. This term taught me that "I will do it later" usually means that it will not be done 
                                the way I want.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                At the same time as all of this, I have started to build better habits. I'm almost forced to 
                                due to the immense lack of external help that I used to have. I use Canvas more consistently,
                                I keep track of due dates with my personal calendar that is fed all the important information
                                from all of my classes, and I am learning how to break bigger projects into smaller
                                pieces so they feel less overwhelming. My time management has improved a lot already and I'm sure 
                                that a harder course load will necessitate that even more. I am still figuring out the balance 
                                between wschool, personal life, and taking care of myself, but I can see substantial progress compared 
                                to the beginning of the term.

                        <h3>Past Struggles and Motivation</h3>
                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>
                                In the past, my main academic struggle was procrastination. This was also very driven by my 
                                high school teachers' lack of urgency. I would put assignments off until the last minute because 
                                "who cares if it's a few days late?" My teachers will grade it the same anyways, and if There 
                                were more strict deadlines, then I would have to rush and rely on my natural ability to pull
                                things together. That worked for a while, but it led to a lot of stress and I would rarely output 
                                my best work. I also never had the opportunity to seek help because teachers would not give me  
                                sympathy someone who turned it in on time might get.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                My motivation for something has always been tied to how interested I am in it. If a topic felt
                                meaningful or connected to my future, I could focus for hours. Coding always grabbed my attention
                                so much better than anything else because it felt like I actually had a talent for it. If something I 
                                had to do for class felt pointless, I would often zone out or distract myself with my phone. 
                                This class helped me see that I cannot just wait to "feel motivated" before I start. I need systems 
                                and routines that push me to get my work done even when I'm tired or not in the mood.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Now my motivation is more connected to who I want to become. I need to be a reliable
                                person who can show up to a high level, important job and handle the complex problems
                                thrown my way. I can't be the person constantly scrambling, uncoordinated in my assignment 
                                and putting it off 'till the last moment. I keep thinking about my future, in a field like 
                                backend development, game development, or data science. These thoughts help me push through 
                                the less exciting parts of university, like readings or smaller busy-work assignments.
                                Because I see them as part of a bigger picture.

                                To do this, I will check Canvas and my email multiple times a day, start major
                                assignments when they are assigned, and put time into them days before they are due.
                                I will study for exams in short chunks instead of cramming. I will review my grades 
                                weekly so I can adjust early instead of being surprised at the end of the term.

                                visualization. I will set aside at least four hours per week for personal coding projects
                                and update my GitHub activity at least twice a month.

                                point, I plan to complete my Computer Science B.S. degree at PSU, apply for at least 
                                one internship or related jobs each summer starting next year, and keep improving my
                                skills in languages and tools that are used in industry. I will also build a professional

                                and stick to my routine for each session. I will log each session in a notes app
                                so I can track my consistency. The goal is to build muscle, reduce stress, and make exercise
                                a more consistent part of my schedule. Each month I will go back and check on my workouts from 
                                that month to make sure I'm staying on track.

                                Over the next year, I want to work up to running at least 10 miles per week. I will 
                                begin at a lower mileage, starting at just 1 to 2 miles per day, with rest days. Then
                                increase by about one mile every two weeks until I reach 10 miles. I will use Strava,

                            <p>
                                This is an imperative goal to keeping a strong wellbeing. Even while living near campus 
                                and focusing on school, I must stay close with my family. I love my parents and am so 
                                thankful for everything that they have done for me. My goal is to have at least one 
                                meaningful visit with my mom every two weeks, and go to / make a nice dinner with my dad
                                monthly. I will put a recurring reminder in my calendar and plan visits or calls ahead of time,
                                especially during the busy parts of the term.

                <p class="section-subtitle">
                    Concrete strategies from this course and from my own experience that I plan to keep using as I move through college and into my career.
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Using time blocking instead of "I will do it later."</strong>
                        I plan to block out specific times in my week for classes, homework, coding projects, exercise,
                        visting/calling my parents and rest. Instead of just hoping I find time, I will treat school work 
                        like appointments that I must show up for. This will help me avoid last minute stressful situations 
                        and procrastination. This also supports my goal of higher grades, staying connected to my family, 
                        and my exercise goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Checking Canvas and email every day.</strong>
                        One major habit I learned in this course is to treat Canvas as the main hub of academic life.
                        I will check Canvas and my PSU email throughout the day so I do not miss updates, and consistently
                        on the weekends because most assignments are due on Sunday. This will help me stay ahead of due dates
                        and announcements like class cancellations and important deadlines that might not be listed elsewhere.
                        This will also help me with my procrastination issue because it won't allow me to miss important information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Breaking large tasks into smaller steps.</strong>
                        When I have a big assignment, project, or test, I will break it into smaller pieces such as
                        reviewing with a friend, doing some practice problems or creating an outline for how I want to complete the task.
                        I will then format these smaller tasks to span over a couple days, instead of doing it all at once.
                        This makes big things feel less, and helps with my procrastination by making my work less overwhelming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Using office hours, tutoring, and peer support.</strong>
                        In the past I would avoid asking for help from my teachers unless I was in dire need.
                        Moving forward, I plan to attend office hours at least once before any major exam or project in my 
                        Computer Science classes. I also plan to visit tutoring and or study labs if I ever feel stuck.
                        I also have a friendly computer science study group where we work through problems together 
                        instead of trying to tackle complicated issues on our own.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Creating a better study environment.</strong>
                        I'm very aware about the issue of having a screen with you while you're trying to complete work. 
                        Technology is so useful but can also be such a major distraction. To focus, I plan to study in 
                        quiet areas on campus or in my apartment with my notifications silenced. 
                        I will split my time into short focusd work sessions, similar to the Pomodoro method, with breaks built in. 
                        This should help me use my energy and time more efficiently instead of getting burnt out and then 
                        defaulting to procrastination.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Connecting coursework to my long term goals.</strong>
                        It's hard for me to care about and assignment or class when it doesn't feel exciting. I 
                        will remind myself how core skills like writing, critical thinking and time management connect 
                        to my end goals. Seeing those links helps me stay motivated with the more boring aspects of 
                        education, when the work itself is not naturally intereseting.

                        <strong>Getting the most out of college.</strong>
                        I want Portland State to be more than just a place where I crawl my way through classes for a degree. 
                        My plan is to actually use the resources available to me. Including but not limited to geting to know professors, 
                        going to office hours, using the library consistently for a quiet place to study and do my work, 
                        and joining at least one club relating to my major. I also want to stay active of course so the  
                        recreation center is the perfect place for me to do that. There are so many resources at my fingertips 
                        that I haven't taken enough advantage of yet. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Building real world experience.</strong>
                        Beginning this coming summer of 2026 I plan to actively look for an internship or job relating 
                        to my major to help build real work experience and expand my portfolio. Since I am not currently working, 
                        I have some space to shape my schedule and begin applying soon. My goal is to apply to at least three 
                        opportunities each term and to treat each applicatoin as practice, even if I don't get the first few positions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Five year vision.</strong>
                        In about five years, I see myself as a more confident and experienced developer who has
                        completed several internships or early career roles. I picture myself working as a backend
                        software engineer or in a job that mixes programming with data analysis or data science,
                        with a strong portfolio that shows what I can actually build. By that time I want to feel
                        comfortable working on a team which is something I don't have a lot of experience in right now,
                        reading and writing code used by others, and continuing to learn new languages and tools 
                        that will help my career trajectory. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Life outside of work.</strong>
                        Of course life isn't only about work. And if I find a job that is more in tune with my goals but 
                        happens to pay less than alternatives it's likely I will take it. I imagine a life where I have 
                        a healthy routine, where exercise and time with family are normal parts of my week.  
                        I want to keep living in a city similar to Portland. I want to have the financial stability to travel, 
                        explore new hobbies, and keep learning new things, not just for a grade.
